Address Resolution Protocol (ARP) is a low-level network protocol for translating
network layer addresses into link layer addresses.ARP lies between layers 2 and 3 of the OSI
model, although ARP was not included in the OSI framework and allows computers to introduce
each other across a network prior to communication.Because protocols are basic network
communication units, address resolution is dependent on protocols such as ARP, which is the
only reliable method of handling required tasks. When configuring a new network computer,
each system is assigned an Internet Protocol (IP) address for primary identification and
communication. A computer also has a unique media access control (MAC) address identity.
Manufacturers embed the MAC address in the local area network (LAN) card
